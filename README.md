## How To Run

First of all, you need to rename the `sample.env` to `.env`.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed!
